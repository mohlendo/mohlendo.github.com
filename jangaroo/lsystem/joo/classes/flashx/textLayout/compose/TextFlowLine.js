/**
 * The TextFlowLine class represents a single line of text in a text flow.
 * <p>Use this class to access information about how a line of text has been composed: its position, height, width, and so on. When the text flow (TextFlow) is modified, the lines immediately before and at the site of the modification are marked as invalid because they need to be recomposed. Lines after the site of the modification might not be damaged immediately, but they might be regenerated once the text is composed. You can access a TextFlowLine that has been damaged, but any values you access reflect the old state of the TextFlow. When the TextFlow is recomposed, it generates new lines and you can get the new line for a given position by calling <code>TextFlow.flowComposer.findLineAtPosition()</code>.</p>
