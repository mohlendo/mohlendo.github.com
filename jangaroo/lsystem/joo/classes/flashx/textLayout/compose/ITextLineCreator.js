/**
 * ITextLineCreator defines an interface for creating TextLine objects for an IFlowComposer instance.
 * <p>The ITextLineCreator interface wraps the FTE line creation methods. There are basically two reasons why an application might want to use this interface to control the line creation. First, if the application has a SWF that contains a font, and you want to use that font from a different SWF, you can reuse the font if the TextLine was created from the same SWF that has the font. Second, you can get a faster recompose time by reusing existing TextLines. TLF does that internally, and when it is reusing it will call recreateTextLine instead of createTextLine. Your application may have additional TextLines that it knows can be reused. If so, in your implementation of createTextLine, you may call TextBlock.recreateTextLine with the line to be reused instead of TextBlock.createTextLine.</p>

   * <p><b>Note:</b> The TextBlock <code>recreateTextLine()</code> method is available starting in Flash Player 10.1 and AIR 2.0. To implement this method so that it is compatible with earlier runtimes, test for the existence of the <code>recreateTextLine()</code> method on the TextBlock object before calling it.</p>
   * @param textBlock The TextBlock object for which the line is to be created.
   * @param textLine The previous line created for the TextBlock, if any.
   * @param previousLine The maximum width of the line.
   * @param width An optional offset value.
   * @param lineOffset If <code>true</code>, at least one character or inline graphic must be fit on the line even if that element causes the line to exceed the value in the <code>width</code> parameter.
   * @param fitSomething <code>fitSomething:<a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/Boolean.html">Boolean</a></code> (default = <code>false</code>)

   * @example The following example implements <code>recreateTextLine()</code> such that it remains backward compatible with versions of the runtime that do not have the TextBlock <code>recreateTextLine()</code> method:
