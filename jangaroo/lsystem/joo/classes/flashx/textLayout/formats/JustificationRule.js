/**
 * Defines values for setting the <code>justificationRule</code> property of the TextLayoutFormat class. Default value is SPACE, which accomplishes justification by adding extra space to the space characters. When you use EAST_ASIAN, Japanese style leading is employed, which applies bottom-down as opposed to top-up, which is used in Roman text. The spacing of punctuation is also different. In the Roman version, the comma and Japanese periods take a full character's width but only half in East Asian. Additionally, the spacing between sequential punctuation marks becomes tighter, obeying traditional East Asian typographic conventions. Also note the leading, applied to the second line of the paragraphs in the example below. In the East Asian version, the last two lines push left. In the Roman version, the second and following lines push left.
