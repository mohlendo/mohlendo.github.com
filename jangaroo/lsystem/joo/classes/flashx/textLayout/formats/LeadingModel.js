/**
 * Defines values for setting the <code>leadingModel</code> property of the <code>TextLayoutFormat</code> class, composed of valid combinations of leading basis and leading direction. Leading basis describes which baselines determine the leading (or <code>lineHeight</code>) of lines in a paragraph. Leading direction specifies whether the <code>lineHeight</code> property refers to the distance of a line's baseline from that of the line before it or the line after it.
