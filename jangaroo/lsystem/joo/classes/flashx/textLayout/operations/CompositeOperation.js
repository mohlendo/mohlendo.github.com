/**
 * The CompositeOperation class encapsulates a group of transformations managed as a unit.
 * <p>The CompositeOperation class provides a grouping mechanism for combining multiple FlowOperations into a single atomic operation. Grouping operations allows them to be undone and redone as a unit. For example, several single character inserts followed by several backspaces can be undone together as if they were a single operation. Grouping also provides a mechanism for representing complex operations. For example, a replace operation that modifies more than one text ranges can be represented and managed as a single composite operation.</p>
 * <p><b>Note:</b> It can be more efficient to merge individual atomic operations rather than to combine separate operations into a group. For example, several sequential character inserts can easily be represented as a single insert operation, and undoing or redoing that single operation is more efficient than undoing or redoing a group of insert operations.</p>
