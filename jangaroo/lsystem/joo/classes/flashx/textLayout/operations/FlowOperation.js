/**
 * The FlowOperation class is the base class for all Text Layout Framework operations.
 * <p>Operations are transformations of a text flow. An Operation class defines the logic for performing and undoing the transformation. Operations are executed by an edit manager. Most applications do not need to create or manage operations directly (unless implementing a custom edit manager).</p>
 * <p>When an operation is performed, the edit manager dispatches an Operation object within the FlowOperationEvent object. You can query this Operation object to decide whether or not to allow the operation, to decide whether to perform some other operation as well, or to update related user-interface elements.</p>
