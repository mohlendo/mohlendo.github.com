   * Builds a playlist without starting to play it from the first stream.
   * <p>The <code>APPEND_AND_WAIT</code> transition mode is used with the <code>NetStream.play2()</code> method to build a playlist without immediately starting to play it from the first stream. Use this mode to load each item in the playlist except the last one. When you load the last stream in the playlist, set the transition mode to <code>RESUME</code>. At this point, Flash Player begins to stream and play the playlist.</p>
   * <p>You can use this mode to build a playlist from scratch, or to rebuild a playlist after a lost connection is recovered. For a new playlist, when <code>NetStream.play2()</code> is called with <code>RESUME</code>, Flash Player begins streaming and playing from the first stream, or from the start position specified. To recover from a lost connection, when you call the <code>NetStream.play2()</code> method with <code>RESUME</code>, Flash Player determines where the stream was interrupted and instructs the server to start streaming from that location. The server in turn is able to determine which stream in the playlist corresponds to that location, and starts streaming from that location.</p>

   * <p>Use this mode when you want to switch to a stream that has the same content but is encoded at a different bit rate or resolution. For example, use this mode when the application queues up streams in a playlist or is playing a single stream at a particular bit rate, then calculates that the bandwidth availability or the CPU capability is either lower or higher than the stream requirements. The application can then update the streams with their higher or lower bit rate versions.</p>
