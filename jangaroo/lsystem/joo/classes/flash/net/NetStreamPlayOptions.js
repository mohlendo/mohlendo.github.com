   * The time in seconds in the stream playback at which the switch to a new stream should be made. The <code>offset</code> parameter is used when a <code>NetStream.play2()</code> call is made with the <code>NetStreamPlayTransitions.SWITCH</code> transition mode. Flash Media Server looks for the nearest switch point after the specified offset time and starts streaming the new stream from that point onwards.
   * <p>Fast switch</p>
   * <p>When this property is specified, Flash Media Server pre-empts the current stream and starts streaming the new stream from the specified index position immediately, without waiting to find a keyframe. Any data after the offset already buffered from a previous stream is flushed. This technique can switch to a new stream more quickly than standard switching, because the buffered data from an older stream doesn't have to play out.</p>
   * <p>The default value of <code>offset</code> is -1, which is fast switch mode. In this mode, switching occurs at the first available keyframe after <code>netstream.time + 3</code>, which is about 3 seconds later than the playback point.</p>
