 * The GraphicsPathWinding class provides values for the <code>flash.display.GraphicsPath.winding</code> property and the <code>flash.display.Graphics.drawPath()</code> method to determine the direction to draw a path. A clockwise path is positively wound, and a counter-clockwise path is negatively wound:
