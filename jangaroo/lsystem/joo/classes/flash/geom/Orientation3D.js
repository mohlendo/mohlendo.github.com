The three types of orientation are Euler angles, axis angle, and quaternion. The <code>decompose</code> and <code>recompose</code> methods of the Matrix3D object take one of these enumerated types to identify the rotational components of the Matrix.

   * The axis angle orientation uses a combination of an axis and an angle to determine the orientation. A line or vector from the center of a three-dimensional globe to the surface is an example of an axis. The axis around which the object is rotated is a unit vector that represents any possible direction in the three-dimensional space. The angle represents the magnitude of the rotation about the vector. The direction determines where a display object is facing and the roll angle determines which way is up. You can use Vector3D and the Matrix3D objects to determine the various matrix transformations as well as to determine important three-dimensional programming values such as the distance to the intersection of two objects that can be used to detect simple collision between three-dimensional objects.
