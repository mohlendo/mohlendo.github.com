/**
 * The Matrix3D class represents a transformation matrix that determines the position and orientation of a three-dimensional (3D) display object. The matrix can perform transformation functions including translation (repositioning along the x, y, and z axes), rotation, and scaling (resizing). The Matrix3D class can also perform perspective projection, which maps points from the 3D coordinate space to a two-dimensional (2D) view.
 * <p>A single matrix can combine multiple transformations and apply them at once to a 3D display object. For example, a matrix can be applied to 3D coordinates to perform a rotation followed by a translation.</p>
 * <p>When you explicitly set the <code>z</code> property or any of the rotation or scaling properties of a display object, a corresponding Matrix3D object is automatically created.</p>
 * <p>You can access a 3D display object's Matrix3D object through the <code>transform.matrix3d</code> property. 2D objects do not have a Matrix3D object.</p>
 * <p>The value of the <code>z</code> property of a 2D object is zero and the value of its <code>matrix3D</code> property is <code>null</code>.</p>
 * <p><b>Note:</b> If the same Matrix3D object is assigned to two different display objects, a runtime error is thrown.</p>
 * <p>The Matrix3D class uses a 4x4 square matrix: a table of four rows and columns of numbers that hold the data for the transformation. The first three rows of the matrix hold data for each 3D axis (x,y,z). The translation information is in the last column. The orientation and scaling data are in the first three columns. The scaling factors are the diagonal numbers in the first three columns. Here is a representation of Matrix3D elements:</p>
 * <p><img src="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/images/Matrix3Delements.jpg" /></p>
 * <p>You don't need to understand matrix mathematics to use the Matrix3D class. It offers specific methods that simplify the task of transformation and projection, such as the <code>appendTranslation()</code>, <code>appendRotation()</code>, or <code>interpolateTo()</code> methods. You also can use the <code>decompose()</code> and <code>recompose()</code> methods or the <code>rawData</code> property to access the underlying matrix elements.</p>
 * <p>Display objects cache their axis rotation properties to have separate rotation for each axis and to manage the different combinations of rotations. When a method of a Matrix3D object is called to transform a display object, the rotation cache of the object is invalidated.</p>

   * Appends an incremental rotation to a Matrix3D object. When the Matrix3D object is applied to a display object, the matrix performs the rotation after other transformations in the Matrix3D object.
   * <p>The display object's rotation is defined by an axis, an incremental degree of rotation around the axis, and an optional pivot point for the center of the object's rotation. The axis can be any general direction. The common axes are the <code>X_AXIS</code> (<code>Vector3D(1,0,0)</code>), <code>Y_AXIS</code> (<code>Vector3D(0,1,0)</code>), and <code>Z_AXIS</code> (<code>Vector3D(0,0,1)</code>).

   * <p>The rotation effect is not absolute. It is relative to the current position and orientation. To make an absolute change to the transformation matrix, use the <code>recompose()</code> method. The <code>appendRotation()</code> method is also different from the axis rotation property of the display object, such as <code>rotationX</code> property. The rotation property is always performed before any translation, whereas the <code>appendRotation()</code> method is performed relative to what is already in the matrix. To make sure that you get a similar effect as the display object's axis rotation property, use the <code>prependRotation()</code> method, which performs the rotation before other transformations in the matrix.</p>

   * <p>The scale is defined as a set of three incremental changes along the three axes (x,y,z). You can multiply each axis with a different number.

   * <p>To modify the matrix's transformation with an absolute parent frame of reference, retrieve the settings with the <code>decompose()</code> method and make the appropriate changes.

   * <p>The <code>decompose()</code> method's parameter specifies the orientation style that is meant to be used for the transformation. The default orientation is <code>eulerAngles</code>, which defines the orientation with three separate angles of rotation for each axis. The rotations occur consecutively and do not change the axis of each other. The display object's axis rotation properties perform Euler Angles orientation style transformation. The other orientation style options are <code>axisAngle</code> and <code>quaternion</code>. The Axis Angle orientation uses a combination of an axis and an angle to determine the orientation. The axis around which the object is rotated is a unit vector that represents a direction. The angle represents the magnitude of the rotation about the vector. The direction also determines where a display object is facing and the angle determines which way is up. The <code>appendRotation()</code> and <code>prependRotation()</code> methods use the Axis Angle orientation. The quaternion orientation uses complex numbers and the fourth element of a vector. The three axes of rotation (x,y,z) and an angle of rotation (w) represent the orientation. The <code>interpolate()</code> method uses quaternion.</p>

   * Inverts the current matrix. An inverted matrix is the same size as the original but performs the opposite transformation of the original matrix. For example, if the original matrix has an object rotate around the x axis in one direction, the inverse of the matrix will have the object rotate around the axis in the opposite direction. Applying an inverted matrix to an object undoes the transformation performed by the original matrix. If a matrix is multiplied by its inverse matrix, the result is an identity matrix.
   * <p>An inverse of a matrix can be used to divide one matrix by another. The way to divide matrix A by matrix B is to multiply matrix A by the inverse of matrix B. The inverse matrix can also be used with a camera space. When the camera moves in the world space, the object in the world needs to move in the opposite direction to transform from the world view to the camera or view space. For example, if the camera moves closer, the objects becomes bigger. In other words, if the camera moves down the world z axis, the object moves up world z axis.</p>

The forward direction vector of the display object (the <code>at</code> Vector3D object) points at the specified world-relative position. The display object's up direction is specified with the <code>up</code> Vector3D object.
   * <p>The <code>pointAt()</code> method invalidates the cached rotation property value of the display object. The method decomposes the display object's matrix and modifies the rotation elements to have the object turn to the specified position. It then recomposes (updates) the display object's matrix, which performs the transformation. If the object is pointing at a moving target, such as a moving object's position, then with each subsequent call, the method has the object rotate toward the moving target.</p>
   * <p><b>Note:</b> If you use the <code>Matrix3D.pointAt()</code> method without setting the optional parameters, a target object does not face the specified world-relative position by default. You need to set the values for <code>at</code> to the -y-axis (0,-1,0) and <code>up</code> to the -z axis (0,0,-1).</p>
   * @param pos The world-relative position of the target object. World-relative defines the object's transformation relative to the world space and coordinates, where all objects are positioned.
   * @param at The object-relative vector that defines where the display object is pointing. Object-relative defines the object's transformation relative to the object space, the object's own frame of reference and coordinate system. Default value is the <i>+y</i> axis (0,1,0).
   * @param up The object-relative vector that defines "up" for the display object. If the object is drawn looking down from above, the <i>+z</i> axis is its "up" vector. Object-relative defines the object's transformation relative to the object space, the object's own frame of reference and coordinate system. Default value is the <i>+z</i>-axis (0,0,1).

   * <p>The display object's rotation is defined by an axis, an incremental degree of rotation around the axis, and an optional pivot point for the center of the object's rotation. The axis can be any general direction.
