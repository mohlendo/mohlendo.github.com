/**
 * ActionScript throws a StackOverflowError exception when the stack available to the script is exhausted. ActionScript uses a stack to store information about each method call made in a script, such as the local variables that the method uses. The amount of stack space available varies from system to system.
 * <p>A StackOverflowError exception might indicate that infinite recursion has occurred, in which case a termination case needs to be added to the function. It also might indicate that the recursive algorithm has a proper terminating condition but has exhausted the stack anyway. In this case, try to express the algorithm iteratively instead.</p>
